# Unix Basics: sed

???

Notes would go here for this slide if I had any.

# Sed is a **S**tream **ED**itor

sed needs two things to operate:

1. a list of commands
2. a source of data

It executes the commands in order and outputs the transformed data.

    $ echo "Hello World" | sed -e "s/World/Nerds/"
    Hello Nerds

# Why Bother Learning sed?

Why bother to learn an old esoteric editor when Atom and Visual Studio
Code and Sublime Text all exist?

- make changes to huge files that traditional editors choke on
- automate changes to files for hands off deployment/maintenance work
- use as a part of a pipeline to extract ad hoc reports from data

# sed needs two things to operate

---

# First: sed needs a list of commands

## The most common sed command is substitute (s)

You can use sed for years and only ever use the substitute command

```
# Search and replace first instance per line
sed -e "s/search_term/replacement/"

# Search and replace all instances per line
sed -e "s/search_term/replacement/g"

# Search via regular expressions and replace
sed -e "s/search_regular_expression/replacement/"

# Expressions are applied in order
sed -e "s/first_term/first_replacement/" -e "s/second_term/second_replacement/"

```

---

# Second: sed needs a source of data

```

# act on one file
sed -e "" input_file

# or multiple files
sed -e "" input_file_1 input_file_2 etc

# or pipe input in to sed
echo "Hello World" | sed -e ""

```
---

# Tanget:  pipes

Pipes can route the output stream of one program into the input stream
of another program.  It's a common tool in shell scripts, so let's see
some examples.

```

$ echo "Hello World" | sed -e 's/World/Nerds/'
Hello Nerds

$ cat /etc/passwd | sed -e 's/:.*//' | grep root
root

```

```
$ time cat MERGED2013_14_PP.csv | sed -e 's/PrivacySuppressed/Suppressed/g' -e 's/NULL//g' > MERGED2013_14_PP-edited.csv

real	0m1.617s
user	0m1.417s
sys	0m0.141s

$ ls -lah MERGED2013_14_PP*
-rwxrwxrwx 1 tim tim 142M Dec 15 13:10 MERGED2013_14_PP.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 tim tim  97M Jun  9 15:47 MERGED2013_14_PP-edited.csv

```

# automate changes to files that might otherwise be done by hand

We can use sed to edit files in scripts.  For instance, we can use sed
to change requiretty to !requiretty in a sudoers configuration file.  If
we make that change on first boot, configuration management tools could
then log in to a new machine and deploy desired settings.

---

# automate changes to files, part 2

Let's rename Tom Sawyer to Todd Sawyer.  Things to watch for:

- Case insensitive search
- Replace Tom with Todd, but not Tomato with Toddato
- Replace all Toms on a line
