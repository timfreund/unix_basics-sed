# Unix Basics: sed

???

Notes would go here for this slide if I had any.

---

# Sed is a **S**tream **ED**itor

sed needs two things to operate:

1. a list of commands
2. a source of data

It executes the commands in order and outputs the transformed data.

    $ echo "Hello World" | sed -e "s/World/Nerds/"
    Hello Nerds

# Why Bother Learning sed?

Why bother to learn an old esoteric editor when Atom and Visual Studio
Code and Sublime Text all exist?

- make changes to huge files that traditional editors choke on
- automate changes to files for hands off deployment/maintenance work
- use as a part of a pipeline to extract ad hoc reports from data

# sed needs two things to operate

---

# sed needs a list of commands

## The most common sed command is substitute (s)

You can use sed for years and only ever use the substitute command

```
# Search and replace first instance per line
sed -e "s/search_term/replacement/"

# Search and replace all instances per line
sed -e "s/search_term/replacement/g"

# Search via regular expressions and replace
sed -e "s/search_regular_expression/replacement/"

# Expressions are applied in order
sed -e "s/first_term/first_replacement/" -e "s/second_term/second_replacement/"

```

---

# sed needs a source of data

```

# act on one file
sed -e "" input_file

# or multiple files
sed -e "" input_file_1 input_file_2 etc

# or pipe input in to sed
echo "Hello World" | sed -e ""

```
---

# Tanget:  pipes

Pipes can route the output stream of one program into the input stream
of another program.  It's a common tool in shell scripts, so let's see
some examples.

```

$ echo "Hello World" | sed -e 's/World/Nerds/'
Hello Nerds

$ cat /etc/passwd | sed -e 's/:.*//' | grep root
root

```

# Why are we here again?  Let's work through examples

---

# make changes to huge files that traditional editors choke on

---

# automate changes to files that might otherwise be done by hand



---

# automate changes to files, part 2

Let's rename Tom Sawyer to Todd Sawyer.  Things to watch for:

- Case insensitive search
- Replace Tom with Todd, but not Tomato with Toddato
- Replace all Toms on a line
