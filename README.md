# Unix Basics: sed

This repository covers the sed command, and it is the first in a
series on unix basics.  It comes in two parts:

1. `./lecture` - start there for background information
2. `./lab` - end there for hands on exercises.  Or start there, I'm a
  README, not a cop.

The lab portion uses open data provided by third parties. Run
"./lab_prep.sh" to download the third party data.
