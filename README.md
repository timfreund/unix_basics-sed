# Unix Basics: sed

This repository covers the sed command, and it is the first in a
series on unix basics.  It comes in two parts:

1. `./lecture` - start there for background information
2. `./lab` - end there for hands on exercises.  Or start there, I'm a
  README, not a cop.

The `./lecture/index.html` file should stand on its own, but you can
also [view the presentation live](https://codemuxer.com/presentations/unix_basics/sed/).

## The Lab

The lab portion uses open data provided by third parties. Run
"./lab_prep.sh" to download the third party data.

Once you've run that script, you should find the following
data sources in your `./lab` directory:

- [MERGED2013_14_PP.csv.gz from the College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/):
- sudoers file from Centos 6.x
- [tom_sawyer.txt from Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/74)
